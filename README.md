# SUPERSTORE-SALES-EXCEL-DASHBOARD
The dashboard unveils critical insights into the company sales:

1. Categories: Which category of product sells better, which category of product was of high demand. As we can see, there are three categories which are furniture, technology and office supplies. Office supplies was in high demand but technology product sold better and gave more profit.

2. Region: The Western region of the USA had more profit for the company,  and as such made more sales of 725, 458, followed by the East with a total sales of 678,781, followed by the Central part of US with a total sum of sale of 501,240 and the Southern part of the USA been the least with a sum total of 391,722.

3. Cities: The western part consist of states like california, washington, colorado, oregon, arizona. It is observed that this states gave more profit to the company which made the West return more sales than the rest. They bought more of technology products. While other states in some regions that bought more of office supplies did not return much sales or profit.



From my analysis, this could be as a result of the fact that the technology products cost more than the office supplies thereby it helped boost the sales from the West. 



However, many people purchased office supplies. This stems from the fact that it was more discounted than the others. Hence customers made high demand purchase of them.
